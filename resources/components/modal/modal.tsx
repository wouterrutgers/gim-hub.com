/**
 * A modal that attaches itself to the body DOM node, which is "root" in this
 * app. Having multiple of these modals open at once will probably cause issues,
 * it is untested. This hook handles focus, adds blurring, adds a clickable
 * background, and more. All calling code needs is to supply a child component,
 * and call the returned `open` function.
 *
 * @param Children - Component to render as a child of the global modal DOM
 *    node. One of its props may be a callback that closes the modal, named
 *    `onCloseModal`, which is supplied by this hook.
 * @returns
 *  - `open`: A function that opens the modal, taking the Child's props as an
 *    argument EXCEPT for `onCloseModal`.
 *  - `close`: A function that closes the modal.
 *  - `modal`: The modal element that needs to be rendered. Should just be
 *    unconditionally rendered, since it will be `undefined` if not open.
